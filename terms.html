								Tail Waggers Club (“TWC”) is a collection of digital art Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”) operating on the Ethereum network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to purchase digital collectibles. You are entirely responsible for the safety and management of your private cryptocurrency/digital asset wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website prior to purchase. Furthermore, as the TWC smart contract operates on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.		
								This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving TWC digital collectibles.		
								These terms and conditions constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you (also referred to herein as “your”) and Tail Waggers Club (“Tail Waggers” and “we” or “us”), governing your ownership of a TWC as part of the TWC NFT Collection (the “Collection”).		
								By entering into this Agreement and by you participating in the Collection you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE COLLECTION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.		
							</p>

							<p class="_terms_text">
								1) Definitions.<br/>
								“Art” means any art, graphics, images, designs, logos, taglines, and drawings that may be associated with a TWC you own.		
								“Equivalent” means the value, in US Dollars, of the market value of the relevant amount of cryptocurrency on the day of the transaction.		
								“Name and Likeness” means name, nicknames, images, likenesses, marks, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress colors, trade dress designs, and/or all other intellectual property of Tail Waggers.		
								“Third Party IP” means any third-party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.		
							</p>

							<p class="_terms_text">
								2) Ownership. You Own the NFT. When you purchase a TWC NFT, you own the underlying TWC Art. Ownership of the TWC is mediated entirely by a smart contract and the Ethereum network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any TWC.		
								i. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you permission to use, copy, and display the owned Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your TWC, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each TWC owner’s right to display the Art of the TWC; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your TWC, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each TWC licensee’s rights to display the Art of the TWC and provided the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the TWC leaves the website/application.		
								ii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we may grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Art and/or the Name and Likeness to use, copy, or display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use could be producing and selling merchandise or displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a venue that permits the display of TWC generally, provided that the venue cryptographically verifies each TWC licensee’s rights to display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of TWC generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each TWC licensee’s rights to display the Art of the TWC and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the TWC leaves the website/application. A Commercial Use license will be considered invalid without our express prior written consent. We, on behalf and for the benefit of the TWC Treasury, retain the right to collect a 40% royalty fee on net profits of any Commercial Use license granted.		
							</p>
							<p class="_terms_text">
								3) Restrictions. You agree that you may not permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the following without express our prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art to advertise, market, or sell any product or service; (iii) use the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict violence, cruelty, or anything that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech, drugs (including, without limitation, both prescription and non-prescription) or other supplements, death, pornography or other “adult only” or sexually explicit activities, massage parlors, prostitution or any dating or escort activities, weapons or ammunition, denigration or discrimination against individuals based on race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or age, medical conditions and/or political campaigns or causes; (iv) use the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art of your TWC for your or any third party’s commercial benefit without the express written consent of Tail Waggers.		
								To the extent the TWC, Name and Likeness, or Art contains Third Party IP you understand and agree as follows: (i) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (ii) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to pass through additional terms and/or restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (iii) to the extent that we inform you of such additional restrictions in writing, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this Agreement.		
								The restrictions in this Section 4 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.		
							</p>	
							<p class="_terms_text">
								4) Termination of the License. The Licensed Rights granted to you hereunder shall automatically terminate and all rights shall return to us if: (i) at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your TWC for any reason except as specifically provided in section 3 of this Agreement; (ii) you breach any of the Agreement and conditions; (iii) you have a trustee, receiver or similar party appointed for your property, become insolvent, acknowledge your insolvency in any manner, make an assignment for the benefit of your creditors, or file a petition of bankruptcy; (iv) you engage in any unlawful business practice related to the TWC; (iv) you initiate any legal actions, except an arbitration as specifically provided herein, against any of Tail Waggers and/or its officers, directors, affiliates, agents, attorneys and employees.

								5) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. ALL TWC ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, NF DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NF BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER AND/OR DEVICE OR TECHNOLOGY FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR FOR ANY FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, AND/OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES BASED ON ANY CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER RELATED TO ANY NFT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE TWC, THE MINT, ANY TECHNOLOGY AND/OR PARTIES RELATED TO THE MINT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BLOCKCHAIN, CRYPTOCURRENCY, OR CRYPTOCURRENCY/DIGITAL ASSET WALLET. YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES WHETHER SUCH ALLEGATIONS ARE FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS BEHAVIOR, NEGLIGENCE, OR FALL UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS UPON WHICH LIABILITY IS CLAIMED AND EVEN IF A DISCLAIMING PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE, AND IN ANY EVENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NF’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE TOTAL SUM PAID DIRECTLY BY YOU TO NF FOR THE APPLICABLE TWC. YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT CYBERSECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ALL OR ANY PART OF THE ABOVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO APPLY TO YOU, THE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO YOU ONLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.		
							</p>
							<p class="_terms_text">
								6) Assumption Of Risk. As noted above, TWC are made available solely for entertainment purposes. You agree that you assume the following risks: 1) To the extent there is a price or market for a blockchain asset such as an NFT, such markets and prices are extremely volatile, and variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of any digital asset(s) you own, including your TWC, and there is no guarantee that your TWC will have or retain any value; 2) the commercial or market value on a TWC that you purchase may materially diminish in value as a result of a variety of things such as negative publicity; 3) there are risks associated with dealing in digital assets (e.g., non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies, etc.) including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software, or internet connection failures, the risk of malicious software, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to data stored within your digital asset wallet or elsewhere, and we will not be responsible for any of these, however caused; 4) we do not promise or guarantee the availability of TWC or the Art on the internet or that anyone will host a TWC or the Art at any specific location and/or for any specific period of time; 5) upgrades to the Ethereum network, a hard fork or other change in the Ethereum network, a failure or cessation of Ethereum, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum network may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using such technologies, including and without limitation to TWC; 6) we do not make any promises or guarantees related to the mint and each of its applications and/or services, including but not limited to the continued availability of either and/or the protection and/or storage of any data you provide to those parties; 7) the risk of losing access to the TWC due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error; 8) the risk of mining attacks; 9) the risk of hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyber attacks and other technological difficulties; 10) the risk of a new regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and/or new regulations, and/or unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of the TWC; 11) the risks related to taxation; 12) that NFTs are not legal tender and are not back by any government; and 13) we are not responsible for any transaction between you and a third party (e.g., your transfer of a NFT from a third party on any secondary market), and we shall have no liability in connection with any such transaction. In addition to assuming all of the above risks, you acknowledge that you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision to purchase the TWC and that you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value (if any), suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself. We cannot and do not represent or warrant that any TWC, or its supporting systems or technology, is reliable, current or error-free, meets your requirements, or that defects in the TWC, or its supporting systems or technology, will be corrected. We cannot and do not represent or warrant that the TWC or the delivery mechanism for it are free of viruses or other harmful components. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays You may experience related to the mint.
